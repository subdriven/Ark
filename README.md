# Ark2

Ultimately this is a personal project which is to help my mom create a program with which she can keep track of animals (Animal Record Keeper). I have no idea what I'm doing but that's never really stopped me before. 

The goal here is to create a way to track animals for a ranch or small farm. Some requirements/ideas I have:

* Small overhead
* Runs locally (preferably not needing a server-like backend)
* SQL backend (likely starting with SQLite)
* Platform agnostic

I will update this with my database schema shortly.
